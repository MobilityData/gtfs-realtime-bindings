Want to contribute? Great! First, read this page (including the small print at the end).

### Before you contribute
Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[MobilityData Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://gist.github.com/barbeau/c4c2b76c40d08db13b6a58bf52666e86#file-mobilitydata-contributor-license-agreement-agreement)
(CLA), which you can do online by clicking on a link after you open a pull request. 
The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even 
after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission 
to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure of various other thingsâ€”
for instance that you'll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other 
people's patents. You don't have to sign the CLA until after you've submitted your 
code for review and a member has approved it, but you must do it before we can put 
your code into our codebase. Before you start working on a larger contribution, you 
should get in touch with us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we 
can help out and possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use Github pull requests for this purpose.
